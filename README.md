This project focused on mastering CSS Flexbox and its interplay with JavaScript. Building upon a tutorial from Wes Bos' JavaScript30, I created an image gallery that dynamically responds to user interactions. By combining Flexbox layout with JavaScript event listeners, I achieved an engaging visual effect where clicking on an image expands it and triggers sliding text elements. This project deepened my understanding of responsive design and interactive web development.
